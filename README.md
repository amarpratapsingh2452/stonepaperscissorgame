<h1 align="center">Stone Paper Scissor: A Step into Web-Based Interactive Development</h1>

<p align="center">
  This repository features my inaugural web development project: a classic <strong>Stone Paper Scissor</strong> game.
  Far more than a simple game, it represents a crucial milestone in my journey to building interactive web applications.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Through this project, I've gained hands-on experience and solidified fundamental web development concepts, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML Structure:</strong> Crafting the semantic backbone of the game.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS Styling:</strong> Bringing the user interface to life with visual design.</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript Logic:</strong> Implementing core game mechanics, user input handling, and dynamic updates for an engaging experience.</li>
  <li><strong>DOM Manipulation:</strong> Learning to interact with and modify web page elements dynamically.</li>
</ul>

  This project is a testament to my dedication to learning and growing as a web developer.
  It demonstrates my ability to integrate front-end technologies to create functional and interactive experiences.
  I'm excited to leverage these foundational skills for more complex and ambitious web projects in the future!
